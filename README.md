### Features
- Book and user data is stored on a firebase persistent database
- Book covers are stored on firebase storage
- Authentication is done via google accounts. A user can still use the app as an anonymous user but there will be no loans attached to their account.
- Users can search the database by query, sort by when the book was added, the title, author and publication of date. Users can also filter the search by genre and/or location.
- Users are also able to see the availabiltiy of each book.
- Authenticated users can see what books they have on loan and when they are due.
- All users can view all the librarie's locations via a google maps fragment and also follow it into the actual google maps app.
- Users can click on the 'More' button to go to the search view sorted in the same order as on the main screen. (Clicking 'More' on the loans screen takes the user to the loans screen not the search screen)
- Animations for the main recycler view on initialisation.
